## Abstract
Structural coloring harnesses optical interference and nanophotonic resonances to obtain colors with a range of applications. Optical coatings exhibiting the photonic Fano Resonance is an ideal platform for structural coloring -- it provides full color access, high color purity, high brightness, controlled iridescence, and scalable manufacturability. For coloring applications that do not require high lateral spatial resolution, FROCs provide a significant advantage over existing structural coloring schemes.

The code in this repository can be used to simulate and numerically investigate the colormetric properties of FROCs as described in the manuscript.
